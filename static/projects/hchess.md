# HChess

---

HChess is a chess "shell" written in Haskell. It was the first real program that
I wrote in Haskell. I wrote it a long time ago, so the design patterns naive,
but it was a fun project that tought me how to use Haskell.

The way it works is that you run the program and it throws you into a shell,
like bash. There are commands that you can enter that move a chess piece. It
checks to see if your move is valid. It will automatically detect a checkmate
and declare a winner.
