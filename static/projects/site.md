# This Site

This is the site that you're currently on! It's written Deno's
[Fresh](https://github.com/lucacasonato/fresh) framework. The uses the Preact JS
framework. This site also uses remark to turn all of the project descriptions
written in markdown into html which is then rendered.

It was a bit of work to use a front end deno framework (instead of a node one),
since they are so new. Fresh isn't even on its 1.0 release!

It's deployed on Deno Deploy, which is free and very easy to use. Overall using
Deno is much nicer than node be cause you don't even need to manage a
packages.json file, you just import a URL. Unfortunately it isn't very mature yet.
I'm looking forwards to it's future developments.
