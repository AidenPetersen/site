# RISC-V Implementation

---

## Purpose

I did this project to learn more about more advanced CPU designs and structures

## Components

This project contains a RISC-V simulator, assembler, and implementation

**Simulator**: This is a simple CLI simulator created so I could learn how to
write a simulator, but also test my CPU easier.

**Assembler**: Just a RISC-V assembler.

**Implementation**: This implementation has a simple branch prediction unit,
cache and is multiscalar. It's written in Scala's Chisel.
